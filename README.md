# Poem

A musical setting of a slightly modified quote from the William Burroughs novel The Western Lands:

"A photo has no light of its own, but it takes light to be seen.
Every time anyone takes a photo, there is that much less light in circulation."

Everyone in the room is asked to go to http://poem.jonath.in/ on their phone or laptop. Each device will display a single button with a word written on it. Each person is instructed to listen carefully for their word to be sung by one of the other phones or laptops around them. When they hear their word, they should push their button, which will play a recording of Melanie Shark singing another word. Others around them will hear this word and if it's a match with what is written on their button, click their button, producing another sung word.

The poem will gradually be exposed from beginning to end, with sections looping creating counterpoint starting at any word that appears more than once in the poem.
